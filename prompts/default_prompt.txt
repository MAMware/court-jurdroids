Generate a single realistic juror profile for a fictional court case. The profile must be returned as a JSON object with the following fields:
- name: Full name, highly diverse (e.g., from different cultural backgrounds like African, Asian, European, Latin American; no repeated names)
- age: Integer randomly selected between 18 and 80
- occupation: Unique role from a diverse set (e.g., nurse, carpenter, accountant, student, retiree, chef, lawyer, artist)
- education: Varied level (e.g., high school, associate's, bachelor's, master's, PhD)
- background: 1-2 unique sentences about their life, hobbies, or traits, emphasizing diversity (e.g., different hobbies, life experiences)
Return only the JSON object, wrapped in a JSON array, with no additional text, explanations, or formatting (e.g., no markdown code blocks). Ensure the profile is unique and avoids patterns from previous outputs. Examples:
