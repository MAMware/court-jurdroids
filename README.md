## Overview

This repository hosts a detailed runbook designed to guide users through the process of:

1.  **Setting up a development environment** 
2.  **Customizing** the agency's features, logic, or appearance according to specific needs.
3.  **Deploying** a functional **test version** of the customized agency to a designated environment.

**(Explain what the "agency" is in a bit more detail here. What does it do? What technology stack is it based on?)**

## Who is this for?

This runbook is intended for:

* Anyone needing to understand the workflow for transparency, colaboration, customizing and testing.
* Developers who need to build upon or modify the framework.
* DevOps engineers or technical teams responsible for deploying and managing test instances.

    *(Adjust this list as needed)*

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

* **Git:** For cloning the repository and version control.
* **[Programming Language & Version]:** e.g., Python 3.9+, Node.js 18+, Go 1.20+
* **[Package Manager]:** e.g., pip, npm, yarn
* **[Containerization Tool (if used)]:** e.g., Docker, Docker Compose
* **[Cloud Provider CLI/Account (if applicable)]:** e.g., AWS CLI, Google Cloud SDK, Azure CLI (with necessary permissions for test deployment)
* **[Specific Tools/Libraries]:** e.g., Terraform, Ansible, specific IDE extensions
* **Basic understanding of:** [Key Concepts, e.g., REST APIs, containerization, the specific domain of your agency]

*(Be specific about versions and necessary configurations)*

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[MAMware]/[court-jurdroids].git
cd [court-jurdroids]
```

### Initial Setup

1.  **(Install Dependencies):**
    ```bash
    # Example for Python
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Example for Node.js
    npm install
    ```
2.  **(Configuration):**
    * Copy the example configuration file: `cp config.example.yaml config.yaml`
    * Update `config.yaml` with your specific settings (API keys, database credentials, environment details). **Note:** Do not commit sensitive information directly. Consider using environment variables or a secrets management system. See `docs/configuration.md` for details.
3.  **(Environment Variables):**
    * Set up any required environment variables. You might provide an `.env.example` file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your values
    ```
4.  **(Docker Setup - if applicable):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d # To start services in the background
    ```

*(Adjust these steps based on your actual setup process)*

## Runbook Sections

This repository is structured around the core tasks. Follow the guides linked below for detailed instructions:

1.  **[Development Environment Setup](./docs/development-setup.md):** Instructions for setting up your local machine for coding, running, and debugging the agency. Includes details on linters, formatters, and running unit tests.
2.  **[Customizing Your Agency](./docs/customization-guide.md):** Guidance on how to modify the agency. Covers topics like changing configuration, adding new modules/features, modifying workflows, or branding.
3.  **[Deploying a Test Instance](./docs/test-deployment.md):** Step-by-step procedures for deploying the agency to a **non-production/test environment**. Includes scripts, target platform details (e.g., local Docker, a specific cloud sandbox), and verification steps. **This guide is NOT intended for production deployments.**

*(Consider putting the actual runbook content in separate Markdown files within a `/docs` directory for better organization, as linked above)*

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** [e.g., Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (Express), Go]
* **Frontend:** [e.g., React, Vue, Angular, None]
* **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis]
* **Containerization:** [e.g., Docker, Kubernetes (for test env?)]
* **Deployment:** [e.g., Docker Compose, Serverless Framework, Helm, Manual Scripts]
* **CI/CD:** [e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI] (Even if just for linting/testing in this repo)

## Troubleshooting

* **Issue:** Common problem 1 (e.g., Dependency conflicts).
    * **Solution:** Steps to resolve it.
* **Issue:** Docker container fails to start.
    * **Solution:** Check logs (`docker-compose logs [service-name]`), ensure ports aren't blocked, verify `.env` file.
* **(Link to a dedicated troubleshooting guide if needed: [`./docs/troubleshooting.md`](./docs/troubleshooting.md))**
* If you encounter issues not listed here, please [check the GitHub Issues](https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name]/issues) or [open a new one](#contact).

alpha progress:
1.  **Be Clear About:** //polish
2.  **Specify the "Test" Scope:** Clearly state that the deployment section is *only* for test environments and perhaps why (e.g., lacks security hardening, uses test credentials, not scalable).
3.  **Link Internally:** If your runbook is split into multiple files (recommended for longer guides), use relative links (`./docs/file.md`) effectively.
4.  **Use Code Blocks:** Format all commands, code snippets, and configuration examples using backticks (`) or triple backticks (```). Specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ```bash, ```python, ```yaml).
5.  **Keep it Updated:** As the development or deployment process changes, remember to update the README and the runbook documents.
6.  **Add Visuals (Optional):** Screenshots or simple diagrams (using tools like MermaidJS supported by GitHub Markdown) can significantly improve understanding.

Good luck with your project and writing the README! Let me know if you have more specific sections you'd like help with.
